    Tools for outputting documentation about classes (Musaico or otherwise).
  </p>

  <p>
    This tool is a crude alternative to javadoc for situations
    where you don't have a browser handy, and / or the javadoc
    is not readily available.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you're ssh'ed into a server, and the
    environment is all set up for running Java programs
    (PATH etc), then to examine a particular class
    "com.example.BuggyMemLeakService", you might run
    something like:
  </p>

  <pre>
        java -classpath /opt/buggy/lib/buggy.jar -jar /tmp/classhierarchy.jar com.example.BuggyMemLeakService
  </pre>

  <p>
    And the output might be something like:
  </p>

  <pre>
        class BuggyMemLeakService [ package com.example ]
        --------------------------------------------------
            extends class java.lang.Object
            implements MemLeakable
   
            BuggyMemLeakService ()
   
            main ( String[] ) : void &lt;&lt;static&gt;&gt;
                throws BuggyException,
                       MemLeakError
            induceBug () : void
                throws BuggyException
   
        &lt;&lt;interface&gt;&gt;
        class MemLeakable [ package com.example.mem ]
        --------------------------------------------------
   
            growHeap ( byte[] ) : boolean
                throws MemLeakError
  </pre>
